          "Currently all functionality is archived without external dependencies, this may change in the future, but the goal is to keep it as minimal as possible.",
          "What makes Magnolia different from other UI libraries is that you write everything TypeScript (including CSS, but you can also do it the traditional way). This gives you a lot more control over the UI and while it's not as easy to use as other libraries, it's a lot more powerful, flexible and has pretty much zero magic included.",
          "To expand on the 'no magic' point, this could be a good or a bad thing, depending on your perspective. But in the end it always comes down to the same thing, you have to write more code, but you have more control over it. And if you're a good developer, Magnolia will be a great tool for you.",
